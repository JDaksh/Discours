# Discours
This is a pet project created to explore (revise) API usage and relevant technologies.

Implemented:
- There is a fully functioning backend for an online forum-esque app where users can post and delete content
- Posts can be created, deleted, updated, and voted on
- Authentication is implemented using JWT Tokens and is enforced
- Technologies used:
- - PostgreSQL for the database
- - Python with FASTAPI for setting up APIs 
- - SQLAlchemy and Alembic to abstract and automate communication with the database
- - While not packaged up as part of the application, I used POSTMAN for managing API requests

In Progress:
- CORS

Future work:
- Heroku, NGINX technologies implement
- Shifting from a windows to linux environment and dockerizing the whole application
- Automating Testing
- CI/CD
